Added 2006-02-07:
JR - Extract DBIC::SQL::Abstract into a separate module for CPAN
   - Chop PK::Auto::Foo up to have PK::Auto refer to an appropriate
   DBIx::Storage::DBI::Foo, which will be loaded on connect from Driver info?
   - Add deploy method to Schema, which will create DB tables from Schema, via
   SQLT
