I think this looks good refactoring wise but there's no comment or
documentation as to what the source_tree method is for or why you'd
actually want to call it - add that and I think it's probably good.

There is an actual method called r_sources() on schema. Please call it
something sensible or privatize.
$args is taken as a hashref only - it is customary for DBIC methods to
take both a hashref and a hashref-as-list

The returned structure needs a massive rework, instead of the nondescript '1',
you need to return something more elaborate. Consider:
- One might want to know which dependencies are views and which are tables
- One might want to know the types of relationships (optional/hard dep)
- One might want to know which dependencies are direct and which are deps of
  deps (this last bit was actually present in the code that was ripped out,
  in a sense what we have now is loss of functionality)
