The functionality, however, seems fine, though I'd like ribasushi to
double check it before merging.

* The diff of BelongsTo.pm from master to HEAD currently reads the following
bollocks:

-  $attrs->{is_foreign_key_constraint} = 1
-    if not exists $attrs->{is_foreign_key_constraint};
+  $attrs->{relationship_target_owns_me} = 1
+    if not $attrs->{relationship_target_owns_me};
+
+  $attrs->{is_foreign_rel} = 1
+    if not exists $attrs->{is_foreign_rel};

* Generally the default fallback is a check is for boolean not. This makes it
impossible to pass in an explicit negative. 7fc30cfd82 claims that I requested
this - I was asking for a change from exists to undef (with the idea that
passing an undef in would negate an inherited value, and reinvoke the default
determination)

* I am still firmly on the opinion that relationship_target_owns_me is an
extremely ugly name. If we want to be both descriptive and fall within a
sane coherent framework we need to rename the rest. Renaming doesn't mean the
old names are not supported, it simply means that the docs and examples are
updated, and that fallbacks for the old names are added in.

owned_by|maybe_owned_by <==> owns_one|maybe_owns_one|owns_many (or perhaps
                                                     owns_some to indicate 0:M)

Then the logical attr name would be owned_by_target

I won't bikeshed the names anymore, if you elect to merge them this way I
reserve the right to laugh at you any time a confused soul complains yet again.
