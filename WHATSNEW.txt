New in this branch:

 * Converted test cases to use SQL::Abstract::Test if available.
	* created DBIC::SqlMakerTest and DBIC::DebugObj helper modules
 	* that way the number of extra parens does not matter
 	* test cases still pass with SQLA 1.24, but also with 1.50RC
		* those tests that make no sense with older SQLA are skipped
	* Added dependency for Test::Deep (used when emulating SQL::Abstract::Test::eq_bind when SQLA is older than 1.50)

 * Removed a wrong TODO test: 95sql_maker_quote.t/"order_by with quoting needs fixing (ash/castaway)"
 	* it never passed and never will (SQLA should not parse the strings in order_by)
 	* asked by mst

 * Made a TODO test non-TODO: 95sql_maker_quote.t/"select attr with star needs fixing (mst/nate)"
 	* this works with SQLA 1.50

 * Removed dead code from DBI::Class::Storage::DBI (sub _RowNumberOver).
 	* neither DBIC, nor SQLA, nor SQLA::Limit uses this (in any version supported by DBIC)

 * Added test cases for every supported order_by syntax.
 * Made DBIC::SQL::Abstract pass on order_by hashref ({-desc => 'colname'}) to SQL::Abstract.
 	* this is the blessed way of doing order by
	* new SQLA supports it
	* formerly DBIC considered this as an error
 * Documented using order_by hashref in DBIx::Class::ResultSet.

 * Added test cases to test if arrayref bind values in insert/update are passed through sql_maker intact.
 * Added test cases to test if arrayref bind values work with a PostgreSQL array type.
 * Added 'array_datatypes' parameter to the sql_maker constructor.
	* formerly SQLA considered these as literal SQL with bind values, now that is \['literal SQL', @bind]
		* the new syntax is consistent (works the same in insert/update and where conditions)
	* fortunately 'array_datatypes' was simply ignored by old SQLA (at least with current version..)
 	* DBD::Pg can use arrayref bind values for PostgreSQL array types
 * Documented using PostgreSQL arrays (in Cookbook).

 * Fixed/improved a few skip and diag messages.
